  Pe -- ri -- win -- kle light!
  Pe -- ri -- win -- kle light!
  You're my lit -- tle twin -- kle joke,
  Pe -- ri -- win -- kle light.

  In the six -- ties,
  On the play -- ground, a
  fif -- ties wind was at my back, I
  Put my
  Pe -- ri -- win -- kle light
  In -- side my chest for keeps.

  Oh lit -- tle, lit -- tle
  light, so dim
  And spark -- like, 'neath
  My churned -- up ster --num,
  Pe -- ri -- win -- kle light!
