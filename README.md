Looking Songs
-------------

These are a collection of poetry songs written by Glenn Becker. They were
retrieved from his personal website, years ago, and at they time they made
quite an impression on me. Under the encouragement of a friend, I started
writing music to go with them.

Some time passed, and I eventually gathered up the courage to directly ask
Glenn whether I could put his lyrics to music. While he said that it was fine,
I was slowly composing less and less frequently, including leaving most of the
songs unfinished.

As time has gone on, my original copies of the notation files, written for the
Finale music editor, were lost. As I only have a single physical copy of the
original three songs I wrote music for, I've decided to put them into the
[LilyPond][lilypond] format. And, since this is now a text-based system, it
makes perfect sense to treat them like any other text-based source files and
put them into revision control.
