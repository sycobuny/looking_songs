Music
-----

**Composer**: Stephen Belcher

The music is licensed as specified above. You may use it, modify it, and/or
perform it privately free-of-charge, so long as the attribution to the
original composer remains. Commercial use, such as for promoting a product or
political position, or use in a network television program may be allowed, but
permission must be obtained first, including of derivative works.

Title and Lyrics
----------------

**Author**: Glenn Becker

The titles and lyrics to these songs were created by Glenn Becker. While I
have privately received his blessing to create these works, I have not
received formal recognition to publish them. Their presence in these files is
not an indication that they are free to use.

Limitations on Use
------------------

Due to this separation of music and lyrics, it is not currently legally
permissible to perform these songs with lyrics intact. Doing so would be at
your own legal peril. Once I receive a more formal acknowledgement that this
or any license is acceptable, I will update the terms.
